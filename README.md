> [!WARNING]
> AArchX is experimental. Do not use it for production workloads.

AArchX loads and runs x86-64 Mach-O programs on Apple Silicon with its own decoder, interpreter, JIT, dynamic linker and syscall layer. It also runs i386 PE code inside Wine's WoW64 process.

The Rosetta package still has to be installed, because it is what ships the x86-64 shared cache. AArchX maps that cache itself and never calls Rosetta's translator.

## Build and run

```sh
make -j
./ocerz version
./ocerz tests/guest/bin/hello
./ocerz /Applications/SomeApp.app/Contents/MacOS/SomeApp
```

`make check` builds the unit and guest tests and runs every gate: the guest suite under the interpreter and under the JIT, the x86-64 differential gate (each guest binary under `-no-jit` and under the JIT must match byte for byte), the i386 differential gate and the dynamic-linking tests. The i386 gate needs the Python `capstone` package.

What is in the box:

- Mach-O loader, x86 decoder, interpreter, arm64 JIT, mini-dyld and syscall layer, all written for this project.
- Live `dyld_shared_cache_x86_64` mapping with fixups, initializers, Objective-C registration and `dlopen`/`dlsym`.
- Native guest threads, libdispatch workqueue bridging, Mach messages, signals and x86-TSO memory ordering.
- x86-64-v3 as Rosetta runs it on macOS 15 and later: AVX2, FMA, BMI1/BMI2, F16C, LZCNT, MOVBE and XSAVE, none of which CPUID advertises under either.
- JIT cache invalidation on guest code writes and executable mapping changes.
- Differential tests for both x86-64 and i386 execution.
- An opt-in native mode that runs Intel programs against synthesized x86 system images bridged to the host's own arm64 functions, in both directions, without the x86 shared cache.

## Application compatibility

Confirmed on 2026-09-11 on an Apple silicon MacBook Air with macOS 26.6.
Each app's x86-64 slice was launched straight from its bundle, for example
`./ocerz /System/Applications/Chess.app/Contents/MacOS/Chess`. Here "works"
means the app drew its main window on screen and stayed up.

| Application | Result under AArchX |
| --- | --- |
| Chess | works and plays: board window, and the `sjeng` engine subprocess answers moves |
| Calculator | works (window on screen) |
| Dictionary | works (window on screen) |
| Font Book | works (window on screen) |
| Grapher | works (window on screen) |
| Digital Color Meter | works (window on screen) |
| Activity Monitor | window on screen; its force-quit support library is not in the x86-64 shared cache |
| Console | window on screen; logs a missing optional library |
| TextEdit / Preview / Script Editor | run; open a document window when given a file to open |
| Steam (x86-64 client) | works with `-cef-disable-gpu` (2026-09-12): bootstrapper, `ipcserver`, client and the CEF web helper with GPU, utility and renderer processes; the window draws with software rendering. Some launches still stall before the web UI starts. See [Steam](#steam). |

Command-line tools match their native output byte for byte
(`tools/apptest.sh cli`, 16 of 16): `uname`, `sw_vers`, `echo`, `ls`, `id`,
`basename`, `wc`, `sort`, `uniq`, `head`, `grep`, `file`, `xxd`, `nm`,
`plutil` and `openssl` (`version` and `dgst -sha256`).

Ollama's command-line binary (`Contents/Resources/ollama`, Go with cgo) works as of 2026-09-13. `ollama --version` prints what it prints natively. `ollama serve` answers its HTTP API (`/api/version`, `/api/tags`, `/api/show`), and `llama-server --list-devices` lists the same devices as it does natively. Getting there took five fixes:
- AVX2, because Go turns on its AVX2 paths under Rosetta without checking CPUID.
- `sigaltstack` reporting `SS_DISABLE`.
- `dlopen` refusing arm64-only dylibs.
- Bare `@loader_path` rpaths.
- Constructors in programs that do not link CoreFoundation.

The Ollama menu-bar app runs too. In a 30-second run it started its own server, served its settings page to its window and shut down cleanly on SIGTERM. Before that, WebKit's allocator stopped it within 10 seconds because it could not suspend a thread (`thread_suspend` returned `MACH_SEND_INVALID_DEST`): workqueue threads that AArchX started ended without running the guest's thread-exit path. Nobody has yet run a model under AArchX.

Not working yet:
- **Safari** starts but never shows a window. In a run on 2026-09-13, WebKit's allocator failed to suspend a thread (`thread_suspend` returned `MACH_SEND_INVALID_DEST`) and stopped the process. Two causes of that failure were fixed the same day. The main thread was missing from AArchX's thread-suspension emulation, and workqueue threads that AArchX started ended without running the guest's thread-exit path. Safari has not been run again since.
- **Photos** aborted in `+[PAOpenGLDevice _sharedPixelFormat:]` because `CGLChoosePixelFormat` returned 10002 for every attribute set. The cause was in AArchX's dyld, not the Rosetta-only `AppleMetalGLRenderer` IOKit service blamed earlier. `_dyld_shared_cache_contains_path` rejected the software renderer's plugin path, which runs through a symlink, and `dlsym` on a shared-cache image searched the whole cache. Both are fixed, and CGL now lists the same renderers and builds the same pixel formats as under Rosetta. Photos has not been run again since.

## Steam

The x86-64 macOS Steam client comes up with its full UI under AArchX, confirmed 2026-09-12: the bootstrapper, `ipcserver`, the client and the CEF web helper with its GPU, utility and renderer processes, all translated, with the Steam window on screen. After its first update the client lives in Application Support, and CEF has to run without GPU acceleration:

```sh
./ocerz "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Steam/Steam.AppBundle/Steam/Contents/MacOS/steam_osx" -cef-disable-gpu
```

Getting the client this far took SysV semaphores for Steam's tier0 threading, an absolute executable path (Steam derives its bundle root from it), `dlopen` of the executable returning the already loaded main image, C++ initializers run in dependency order, and a guest arena big enough for Chromium's PartitionAlloc, which reserves a 32 GB region at startup. The arena is now 256 GB, because JavaScriptCore's Gigacage asks for a single 128 GB mapping.

`steam_osx` starts `ipcserver` with `launchctl load -S Background` on a plist it writes into Application Support, which would have launchd run it natively. AArchX rewrites that plist on the way through, putting itself in front of `ProgramArguments` and in `Program` (Steam's own plist only has `Program`, so the array is built from it), and enables the job's label first: a legacy `launchctl unload` leaves the label disabled, and every load after that fails with an I/O error while the client reports `ipcserver init failed`. The Mach service lookup itself was never the problem, since Mach traps go straight to the host kernel.

CEF's GPU process initializes ANGLE through CGL. Until the dyld fixes described under Photos above, every CGL pixel format failed, so CEF ran with `-cef-disable-gpu` and rendered through SwiftShader, which works and is slower. Steam has not been tried with GPU acceleration since those fixes.

The client then waits for the web helper to report ready, polling every 50 ms for 120 s, and gives up on the UI if it does not. Three JIT problems kept the helper from making it:

- Threads blocked on the JIT lock could lose their wakeup and wedge translation for the whole process. The lock is now taken with trylock, yields and short sleeps, and never parks.
- A page invalidated three times was left to the interpreter until it had been quiet for 1.5 s. Hot shared-cache pages in ICU, libdispatch and Foundation never went quiet: one ICU page was refused translation about 30 million times in a two-minute run. A blacklisted page is now also retranslated after 4096 refusals.
- An alignment or commpage fault marks its block and invalidates its 64 KB granule, and the JIT's code index still finds retired blocks. Every other thread still running the retired translation faulted as well, found the block already marked, and invalidated the granule again, discarding the translation that had just been fixed. A fault from a retired translation now simply recovers.

The last two changes took translate refusals from about 25 million to under 64 thousand per run, and the renderer has come up 85 to 151 s after launch. Some launches still stall before the web helper starts its child processes, with the JIT lock held inside translation; relaunching gets past it.

Three helper failures are fixed since. Renderers died on libc++'s `sort.h:643: assertion __first != __end failed: Would read out of bounds, does your comparator satisfy the strict-weak ordering requirement?`: the JIT fused a `cmp`/`jcc` pair whose branch returns to the top of its own block and jumped back without recording the flags, and libc++'s partition loop starts with a `jbe` on the previous iteration's compare. Such self-loops are no longer fused when their head reads flags; `tests/dynamic/cef_partition.s` is that loop. The sandboxed GPU, utility and renderer processes also loaded the 386 MB CEF framework twice, because the helper `dlopen`s it again through the `Contents/Frameworks` symlink and `realpath` fails inside the sandbox; loaded images are now matched by device and inode, as dyld does. Steam's `hardwareupdater`, a PyInstaller Python, crashed until upward links in the `dylib_use_command` form of `LC_LOAD_DYLIB` stopped counting as initializer-order edges.

`Steam Helper` is launched with `--use-mock-keychain`. Without it Chromium reads its "Steam Safe Storage" item from the login keychain at startup; the item does not trust the ocerz binary, so macOS asked for the password once per helper process, and the helper blocks until the prompt is answered. Cookies CEF stores under AArchX are encrypted with the mock key instead, so they are not readable by a native Steam, nor the reverse. `OCERZ_NO_MOCK_KEYCHAIN=1` turns this off.

## Wine and i386

Wine 11.8 runs x86-64 and i386 PE applications through AArchX. With a WoW64 prefix, 32-bit Notepad and WineMine load `winemac.drv` and open titled Cocoa windows. They stay up. Until 2026-09-05 every Wine GUI process died about 24 seconds in: a CoreSpotlight category that never attached threw inside a dispatch block, and an IOSurface page the kernel mapped for the process sat at an address the guest could not see. Both are fixed; the first is why CoreSpotlight is in the default Objective-C preload list. The Wine launchers turn on the Objective-C category preload that AppKit needs; the workqueue bridge is on for every process now, because a Cocoa application deadlocks without it.

```sh
WINE="/path/to/Wine Devel.app/Contents/Resources/wine"
export WINEARCH=wow64
export WINEPREFIX="$HOME/.wine-ocerz"

./ocerz "$WINE/bin/wine" wineboot -u
./ocerz "$WINE/bin/wine" notepad
```

MacNdCheese's Wine build runs under AArchX as well, and Steam is the application the Wine work is measured against. Exceptions raised in 32-bit code now reach the 32-bit handler. Until 2026-09-05 the decoder folded `mov r/m, sreg` into the long-mode constants, so the 32-bit `RtlCaptureContext` recorded the 64-bit code selector, WoW64 copied it into the frame it restores with `iretq`, and the 32-bit exception dispatcher ran as 64-bit code until the stack overflowed. Every Steam process died that way within a second of starting, at its first `OutputDebugString`, and Steam relaunched itself in a loop. Selectors are CPU state now, and a far transfer takes the low 16 bits of a selector slot the way the hardware does, because Wine's `I386_CONTEXT` leaves stack garbage above them. A 32-bit program that raises and catches exceptions runs to completion; the guest tests `mov_sreg` and `far_sel_bits` and the i386 differential case `mov-sreg` pin the behavior. Steam's client core starts: the connectivity test passes and CEF runs the login page's JavaScript. SSE4.2 is implemented and advertised because Steam checks for it.

Memory is the next limit: Steam is nineteen emulated processes, and each one used to carry private copies of every file it mapped, because guest pages are 4 KB and host pages 16 KB. A private file mapping whose file offset and guest address agree modulo 16 KB, which is nearly all of them, now maps its aligned interior straight from the file, so PE images and the fonts Wine enumerates live in the shared page cache. That took 200 MB off a WineMine process and a second off the boot. The other big item was the JIT's own bookkeeping: every translated block kept the full 96-byte decode of each of its instructions and a fixed table of eight branch edges, 1.6 KB per block across 215,000 blocks. A published block now keeps a 16-byte reference per instruction, full copies only of the few instructions it still runs through the interpreter or inspects during fault recovery, and exactly the edges it has. A WineMine process went from 1.1 GB to 714 MB of footprint over the two changes, explorer from 860 MB to 611 MB, with the xbench table unchanged. The test watchdog measures the group's physical footprint rather than RSS, since RSS counts the shared cache in every process.

Rosetta runs i386 PE code through Wine WoW64 too, so AArchX's i386 support is replacement parity rather than something new. Standalone i386 Mach-O applications are not supported by current macOS or its SDKs.

Apple M2 Max, 2026-09-04, `REPS=5`, paired delta `t(n) - t(n/2)`, byte-identical output. Reproduce with `python3 tests/xbench_compare.py`. `hash` and `chase` are ties that no translation can move: `hash` is a chain of multiply, shift and or per step and both sides are bound by multiply latency; `chase` is a dependent-load chain and both sides wait on the cache. Anything within a couple of percent of 1.00x flips from run to run, and a busy machine moves every ratio by that much.

The same suite built for x86-64-v3 (`clang -march=x86-64-v3`, so AVX2, FMA and BMI throughout) used to lose ten kernels, three of them by 4x to 13x, because its VEX and BMI instructions went to the interpreter. On 2026-09-15, on an Apple M5, it wins twelve of the fifteen (`vm` 0.73x, `fpsse` 0.77x, `jtab` 0.91x, `mixed` 0.93x, `memcpy` 0.94x, `fpvec` 0.96x) and loses none by more than 7% (`str` 1.06x, `leafcall` 1.03x, `idiv` 1.00x). The same day's run of the SSE2 build on that machine: ten wins, five losses, none above 1.06x.

`mixed` was a 1.20x loss for a long time, and the whole gap was the price of bit-exact x86 NaN semantics: every packed FP result needed a check before anything could use it. The JIT now defers that check to the compares that read the value, and Rosetta-style hot paths that the compiler split with rare-case branches get retranslated with the hot side inline. Both are exact; the NaN tests in `tests/guest` compare bit patterns against the native binary.

The deferred check has since become one batch per run of floating-point work: zeroing, unpacks, `movddup`, stores, and `ucomisd` with its branch all stay inside the batch, a stored value is checked right before the store, a branch out of the loop carries its check in the exit stub, and at the batch's end only the registers the loop still reads are checked. nbody's SSE2 pair loop went from 107 to 86 host instructions per iteration that way, 42 of which had been NaN bookkeeping. The VEX.128 arithmetic and the scalar FMA forms are batch members too, registers that only ever hold doubles are reduced as doubles (a `fmaxv.4s` over a double reports a NaN for one value in 256), and `tests/run_guest_tests.sh` runs the NaN tests once more with every deferred check forced to take its replay arm. A store that might alias an earlier load of the batch used to end it, because the replay re-executes the loads; the batch now keeps the memory it is about to overwrite in a spare vector register and the replay arm writes it back first, so a loop that updates its data in place is one batch. Those pre-images live in registers rather than the CPU struct: the nbody loop turned out to be bound by its stores, and four extra stores per iteration cost more than the merged batch gained. Packed FMA is a batch member, and a block with VEX.128 code clears the upper halves through a zero register, one 16-byte store instead of two. Two adjacent 16-byte moves become one `ldp` or `stp`; a fault on such a pair is re-run from its first instruction in the interpreter, so the guest sees the signal at the right one. A `vzeroupper` in a block without 256-bit instructions tests a per-thread flag and skips its sixteen stores when the upper halves are already zero, and a stack access through `rsp` folds its displacement into the load or store instead of computing the address first.

These kernels never create a thread, fork or map shared memory, so they run in plain memory mode throughout. A program that does any of those retires plain mode for good (`ocerz_jit_require_ordered`) and pays for x86-TSO ordering on every scalar load and store; Wine is always in that mode. Under `OCERZ_NO_PLAIN_MEM=1` the same table reads 1.35x on `memcpy`, 0.99x on `fpvec`, 1.08x on `str`, 1.13x on `chase` and stays at parity elsewhere. Scalar accesses use acquire and release forms (flags, locks and atomics are scalar, and a release store orders every earlier vector store); SSE loads and stores are left plain, the default FEX ships too, because ordering them cost 3.3x on `memcpy` and 3.0x on `fpvec`. `OCERZ_TSO_VECTOR=1` orders them as well.

Leaving SSE accesses plain is what moved the two kernels that real applications lean on. In ordered memory mode `memcpy` went from 3.55x to 1.35x of Rosetta and `fpvec` from 3.67x to 0.99x, with `str` and `chase` unchanged and everything else at parity.

```mermaid

    y-axis "x Rosetta" 0 --> 4

    bar [1.35, 0.99]
```

The tall bars are the previous ordered-mode cost, the short bars the current one; the dark line at 1.0 would be Rosetta's speed.

### AVX2, FMA and SSE kernels

Every VEX-encoded instruction used to leave translated code for the interpreter, so AVX2 and FMA loops ran up to 100 times slower than under Rosetta. The JIT now translates the instructions these kernels spend their time in.

Timings are best of 5 on an Apple M5 with macOS 26.6.2, taken 2026-09-14 on an idle machine; the nbody and mandelbrot rows were re-measured on 2026-09-15, all three columns in one sitting. "Before" is the build at `31bff03`.

| Kernel | Before | Now | Rosetta |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `memclr` 32 MB, AVX2 `vmovdqu` | 24.12 ms | 0.57 ms | 0.56 ms |
| `indexbyte` 32 MB, AVX2 | 71.98 ms | **0.85 ms** | 1.48 ms |
| `memeq` 32 MB, AVX2 | 64.79 ms | **0.86 ms** | 1.72 ms |
| int32 loop 4M, clang AVX2 | 135.35 ms | **0.44 ms** | 1.30 ms |
| int32 loop 4M, clang SSE4.1 | 29.48 ms | **0.56 ms** | 0.78 ms |
| saxpy 4M, clang AVX2+FMA | 37.62 ms | **0.33 ms** | 0.48 ms |
| nbody 200k steps, scalar SSE2 | 72.90 ms | 6.13 ms | 5.92 ms |
| nbody 200k steps, scalar AVX2 | 1125.37 ms | **6.97 ms** | 10.57 ms |
| nbody 200k steps, scalar AVX2+FMA | 904.45 ms | **6.31 ms** | 9.47 ms |
| mandelbrot 400x400, scalar SSE2 | 19.97 ms | 12.07 ms | 11.26 ms |
| mandelbrot 400x400, scalar AVX2 | 828.24 ms | **10.95 ms** | 11.44 ms |

Wine runs in a third address map, the low shadow, where every memory access needs a range check because guest addresses below 12 GB and a strip at the top of the address space live at their own host bases. The scalar and 256-bit register caches run there now that fault recovery reconstructs them, but the fast memory forms, base hoisting, move pairs and the batch undo log still need a host address that can be formed without a check, so the suite is slower than Rosetta in that map.

The first three kernels are hand-written loops shaped like Go's runtime routines. The rest are C loops, which clang vectorizes except for nbody and mandelbrot, which stay scalar.

Scalar floating-point loops now take 0.9 to 1.2 times Rosetta's time, whether they were built for SSE2 or for x86-64-v3. The scalar results stay in host lane registers across a loop instead of being merged back into the guest register after every operation, and 256-bit loops keep the upper halves of their `ymm` registers in host registers too.

## CLI

```text
usage: ocerz [-v] [-trace] [-strace] [-no-jit] [-native|-cache] [-path file] [--] program [args...]
       ocerz version
```

| Option | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `-v` | more logging |
| `-trace` | trace guest instructions |
| `-strace` | trace guest syscalls |
| `-no-jit` | interpret this process only |
| `-native` | bind the guest against native arm64 frameworks instead of the x86 shared cache (see [Native mode](#native-mode)) |
| `-cache` | bind the guest against Apple's x86_64 shared cache; the default |
| `-path file` | load `file` but keep the following guest arguments as they are |
| `--` | end of AArchX options |
| `version` | print the name and version (`AArchX 0.1`) |

| Environment | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `OCERZ_MODE=native\|cache` | pick the mode when no flag does; this is how a spawned child inherits it, and an unrecognized value is refused rather than ignored |
| `OCERZ_BRIDGESTAT=1` | in native mode, print how many times each bridged function was called, at exit |
| `OCERZ_BRIDGELOG=1` | in native mode, name every bridged call as it happens |
| `OCERZ_NO_BRIDGE_FASTCALL=1` | in native mode, have translated code reach every bridged call through the trap and the dispatcher instead of calling the bridge from inside the block |
| `OCERZ_APIDB=dir` | in native mode, read the API database from `dir` instead of `runtime/apis` beside the ocerz executable |
| `OCERZ_NOJIT=1` | interpret the whole process tree |
| `OCERZ_NOJIT_EXE=<text>` | interpret processes whose command line matches |
| `OCERZ_NO_HOSTWQ=1` | turn the host workqueue bridge off (it is on by default; `OCERZ_HOSTWQ=1` is still accepted and still means on) |
| `OCERZ_NO_LOADMAP=1` | do not drive a cache image's objc `map_images` before its `+load` runs (it is on by default; the map precedes load as native dyld does, so a framework pulled up only as a transitive dependency does not reach `+load` with un-mapped classes) |
| `OCERZ_NO_UNSTICK=1` | never EINTR a guest thread out of a long wait (the unstick monitor otherwise kicks psynch, semwait, kevent, workq, ulock and Mach waits parked over 800 ms) |
| `OCERZ_NO_THREADACT=1` | hand `thread_suspend`/`thread_resume`/`thread_get_state` on guest threads to the host kernel instead of emulating them (the kernel stops a thread anywhere, even holding the JIT lock, and cannot report x86 registers) |
| `OCERZ_UNSTICK_ALL=1` | let the unstick monitor kick every blocking call, `read`/`recvmsg`/`poll` included, as it used to; apps that do not expect EINTR there fail |
| `OCERZ_NO_PLAIN_MEM=1` | ordered memory forms from the start |
| `OCERZ_TSO_STRICT=1` | order stack-relative accesses too |

## Native mode

Apple ends general-purpose Rosetta after macOS 27, and with it the `dyld_shared_cache_x86_64` that every guest binds against by default. Native mode is the answer to that. The guest keeps its x86_64 Darwin personality, but its system libraries are synthesized x86 images whose exports lead into the host's own arm64 code, so a call into libSystem runs the real native implementation instead of translated Intel code. It is selected with `-native` or `OCERZ_MODE=native`, and cache mode stays the default.

Today native mode runs command-line programs whose calls stay inside what is bridged, which is most of libSystem: 2669 of its functions cross to the host, among them the C string, memory, stdio, file, time, locale and user-database functions and their fortified `_chk` forms, the heap, POSIX threads with their mutexes and condition variables, libdispatch's function-pointer entry points, including its semaphores, and `atexit`; thread-local variables and signal handlers with their masks and alternate stacks are answered by ocerz itself; 777 CoreFoundation functions cross, among them CoreFoundation's strings, arrays, dictionaries, numbers, data and run loop, including guest callbacks and run-loop timers, observers and sources. Objective-C programs that use Foundation's strings, numbers, collections, values and formatted output run against the native Objective-C runtime, and so do their own classes, categories and protocols, including `NSView` subclasses that AppKit draws. A program compiled normally, with optimization and clang's default stack protector, binds and runs, and so does one linked for a macOS older than 12 with classic lazy binding. AppKit and CoreGraphics are synthesized from the SDK like the rest, but a full application has not run yet. Every kernel of `xbench_dyn` produces byte-identical output in native mode and cache mode, under both the JIT and the interpreter.

**System libraries without files.** A guest that links `/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib` finds nothing behind it, because on a current macOS that library exists only inside the cache. So ocerz builds one. `src/vdylib.c` assembles a real x86_64 Mach-O in memory, with load commands, `__TEXT`, `__DATA` and an export trie, and the loader takes it as an ordinary image. Nothing in the loader reopens a file, so import resolution, `dlopen` and `dladdr` work on it unchanged. No cache is mapped, the dyld API shim is not installed, and the host workqueue bridge stays off, because the host's own libdispatch needs the process's single workqueue slot.

**The API database.** What each synthesized library exports, and how each export crosses, is data rather than code: one text file per library under `runtime/apis/macos/<sdk version>/`, such as `libSystem.B.dylib.api` and `CoreFoundation.api`, with a record per export. A `fn` record names the host function and its signature, `data` a native variable the export resolves to, `special` a function ocerz answers itself, `stub` an export that binds but stops with a named message when called, with the reason, and `shape` and `struct` records describe the structures of function pointers the bridge converts. ocerz reads the files for the guest's minimum macOS version, beside its own executable or from `OCERZ_APIDB`, and refuses a malformed file whole, naming its line, rather than binding some imports to the wrong thing. Supporting another library is a data change, not a rebuild.

The files are generated. `tools/sdkgen.sh <library>`, for libSystem, CoreFoundation, CoreGraphics, libobjc, Foundation and AppKit, reads the library's `.tbd` for the exact list of x86_64 exports and parses its headers with the Command Line Tools' libclang once for x86_64 and once for arm64. An export whose declaration maps onto the engine's classes on both architectures crosses; one that cannot cross correctly, because it is variadic, takes a structure by value or a `long double`, `va_list` or block, or points at a structure whose layout differs between the architectures, binds as a stub that names itself when called. `tools/sdkgen/overrides` holds what no header can say: the functions ocerz answers itself, the shapes of callback structures, and the calls a generic crossing would get wrong inside an emulator, such as `fork`, `exec`, `setjmp`, `dlopen` and `mmap`. Each run writes its coverage to `tools/sdkgen/baseline` and fails if a crossing was lost, and `tools/sdkgen/layout_check.sh` checks the generator's structure layouts against clang's own.

**Calls out.** Every export is twelve bytes of real x86: a move of the export's id into `r11`, then a jump through a slot that holds one address for the whole process, inside the trap window the decoder and both engines already watch. `src/bridge.c` catches the trap, or, from translated code, is called directly from inside the block that jumps to it. `src/abi.c` reads the arguments out of the guest's register state according to the function's signature, and `src/abicall.s` loads them into the arm64 argument registers and calls the real function. The signature matters because the two ABIs count integer and floating-point arguments in separate sequences, so one `double` in the middle of a signature moves nothing on one side and everything on the other. It also keeps widths honest: arm64 makes the caller extend a narrow argument, and a 32-bit result can come back with the upper half of the register dirty.

**Calls back.** A native function that takes a function pointer calls it, and when the guest supplied that pointer it names x86 code native code cannot jump to. So a callback argument carries its own signature, `qsort` being `v(pLLc{i(pp)})`, and the guest function is bound to one slot in a fixed, assembled bank of 65536 arm64 trampolines. Native code receives the slot's address, and the same function always gets the same address. When native code calls the slot, the guest function runs on that thread with its arguments where System V expects them. A comparator can make bridged calls of its own, and nesting goes as deep as the guest's stack allows.

**Threads the guest never created.** A framework calls back on threads of its own: libdispatch runs work on its workers, and a run loop or an audio device has a thread of its own too. Such a thread has no x86 registers and no guest stack. The first time one calls a guest function it is given a guest personality of its own: a cpu, a guest stack and a guest thread block behind `gs`, registered like any other guest thread and reused on every later call. Because a second thread running guest code is a second observer of guest memory, that also retires plain memory mode, as starting a guest thread already does. The personality is torn down when the host thread exits. `dispatch_async_f`, `dispatch_apply_f` spreading work across several workers at once, and guest work that makes bridged calls and nested callbacks of its own all run this way.

**Guest threads.** `pthread_create`'s start routine is exactly such a callback, so guest threads need nothing further: the native `pthread_create` starts a host thread, that thread is given a guest personality on its way into the start routine, and the result comes back through `pthread_join`. Mutexes and condition variables are forwarded unchanged. That is sound because `pthread_mutex_t`, `pthread_cond_t` and the other pthread types have the same size, alignment and initializer values on x86_64 and arm64, so a mutex a guest initialized statically is already a valid native one.

**Thread-local variables.** A `__thread` variable is reached through a descriptor whose first word is a thunk the compiler calls with the descriptor in RDI, expecting the variable's address back in RAX. In cache mode that thunk is dyld's own x86 code from the shared cache. In native mode the synthesized libSystem exports `__tlv_bootstrap` and ocerz answers it: each image's descriptors are rewritten at load time with an ocerz key per image, and each thread keeps a table of its per-image blocks in its guest thread block, filled from the image's template on first touch and freed when the thread goes away. The thunk's convention preserves every register except RAX, and compilers rely on that, so its stub, unlike every other, saves `r11` across the trap.

**CoreFoundation.** `/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Versions/A/CoreFoundation` is the second synthesized image, and its exports lead into the host's own CoreFoundation. A `CFTypeRef` crosses unchanged in both directions: a position-independent guest runs in the identity address map, so a native object is an address the guest can hold, compare and hand back, and the same object fetched twice is the same pointer. Its data symbols, `kCFAllocatorDefault`, `kCFTypeArrayCallBacks`, the `CFSTR` class reference and the rest, are exported as absolute addresses of the native variables themselves rather than as copies, so a `CFSTR` literal compiled into the guest is a valid native constant string and `&kCFTypeArrayCallBacks` is the address CoreFoundation knows. `Boolean` and `UniChar` travel as 8- and 16-bit classes, extended the way arm64 expects and x86 does not guarantee. A structure of function pointers passed by address, an array's or dictionary's callbacks or a timer's, observer's or source's context, is copied and each guest function in it is given a trampoline, while a pointer that already names native code, as every field of a copy of `kCFTypeArrayCallBacks` does, passes through unchanged. Opening the native framework runs its initializers, and `__CFInitialize` calls `setenv`, so the guest's environment is a copy taken before loading starts.

**Objective-C.** libobjc and Foundation are synthesized too, and an Intel program that sends messages to Foundation objects runs against the native runtime with no x86 runtime of its own. Every class it names, `NSString` or the `NSConstantIntegerNumber` behind an `@42` literal, is exported as the native class itself. Before any guest code runs, each image's selector references are rewritten to the native runtime's selectors, so a guest compares selectors the way native code does. `objc_msgSend` and its super and `_stret` forms are answered by ocerz: it asks the native runtime for the receiver's class and the method's type encoding, turns the encoding into a signature, caches it per class and selector, and sends the message through the native `objc_msgSend` under that signature, with a structure result such as an `NSRange` or a `CGRect` placed wherever each ABI wants it. A method the class does not implement is signed through `methodSignatureForSelector:` and forwarded natively. A nil receiver answers zero. Foundation's methods declared with an ellipsis, `stringWithFormat:`, `arrayWithObjects:` and the rest, are listed by name, since an encoding does not say a method is variadic, and their extra arguments are gathered from where System V left them and packed into eight-byte stack words as Apple's arm64 expects. The printf family, `NSLog` and `CFStringCreateWithFormat` work the same way: the format string says what each argument is, and the arguments go to the native `v` form as a `va_list`. An uncaught Objective-C exception is reported with the bridged call it escaped from before the process ends as it would natively.

**Classes of the guest's own.** A program that defines Objective-C classes, subclassing `NSObject` or `NSView`, has them realized by the native runtime in place: the class structures the Intel compiler emitted are laid out the same on both architectures, so ocerz rewrites each method list to hold native trampolines into the guest's x86 methods, points the class at it and hands the class to `objc_readClassPair`, superclasses first. The guest's own references to its classes stay valid, native code calls a guest `-drawRect:`, `-hash` or `-compare:` like any other method, and the runtime slides a subclass's instance variables past the native superclass's arm64 size and writes the offsets the guest's code reads. Categories are added to guest or native classes, protocols are matched to native ones by name or registered, and `+load` methods run before main, followed by every guest image's C and C++ initializers, a library's before the program's. A method whose types cannot cross is installed as a stub that names itself if native code calls it. The trampoline bank holds 65,536 methods, sharing one parsed signature per distinct type string.

**Signals.** A signal handler is x86 code, so a native `sigaction` cannot be handed one. `sigaction`, `signal`, `sigprocmask`, `pthread_sigmask`, `sigaltstack`, `raise`, `kill` and `pthread_kill` are answered by ocerz itself, against the same handler table, masks and alternate stacks the syscalls change in cache mode, and a handler is entered through a small x86 trampoline ocerz writes into guest memory in place of the `_sigtramp` an x86 libc would supply. A handler runs on the state after the call that raised it, so `raise` returns with its handler already run, and a signal unblocked by `sigprocmask` is delivered before that call returns. A signal from outside, or from another thread, is delivered when the receiving thread's next bridged call returns, the way cache mode delivers one at the next syscall; a thread spinning in its own code without calls does not see it in either mode.

**Data exports.** Not every import is a function. A stack-protected program reads `___stack_chk_guard` in every function prologue, so the synthesized libSystem exports it as a data slot the export trie points at directly, holding a random canary drawn when the image is built. `_environ`, `___progname`, `__DefaultRuneLocale`, `___stdoutp` and `___stderrp` are data symbols too and are left out on purpose: each is tied to native state a constant would get wrong, and an import that fails to bind says so where a wrong value would not.

**Faults.** A bridged call is the one place a thread the guest drives runs native code. A fault during one is reported as such, naming the call and saying whether the faulting address was in guest space, meaning the guest passed a bad pointer, or outside it, meaning ocerz marshalled the call wrong. The process stops there, because a native frame can be neither resumed nor unwound:

```text
ocerz: BRIDGE-FAULT[35366] SIGBUS inside a bridged call, not in guest code
ocerz:   call=/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib:_strlen sig='L(p)' host_fn=0x18980eac0 depth=1
ocerz:   cause: the fault address is in guest space, so the guest passed a bad pointer to _strlen
```

A guest fault inside a callback is the guest's own and is handled the ordinary way. A guest writing into a page it has already executed still has its translation invalidated and carries on, even when the write came from a bridged `memcpy`.

**What is not bridged.** An export with no bridge behind it names itself and stops with exit status 72. An import that never bound at all stops the process with 71 before the guest runs, so the two failures stay distinguishable. An import is looked for only in the library it names: a CoreFoundation import CoreFoundation does not export is reported as missing rather than bound to a libSystem export of the same name. A static image is refused outright.

```text
$ ./ocerz -native ./hello_printf
ocerz: bridge: /usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib _printf not implemented
```

A variadic function crosses only through a veneer that knows where its named arguments stop and what the rest are. Apple's arm64 passes every variadic argument on the stack in eight-byte slots and uses no floating-point register, the opposite of its packing for an ordinary call, so a fixed signature would be wrong. The printf family, `NSLog`, CoreFoundation's format functions and Foundation's variadic methods have veneers; `open`, `fcntl`, `ioctl`, `scanf` and the rest do not yet. A structure passed or returned by value is written with its members in braces, `{LL}` for `NSRange` and `{{dd}{dd}}` for `CGRect`, and crosses as bytes gathered from wherever one ABI put it and scattered to wherever the other wants it: System V classifies a small structure eightbyte by eightbyte and returns anything over sixteen bytes through a pointer in RDI, while Apple's arm64 passes up to four floats or doubles in vector registers, any other structure over sixteen bytes as a pointer to a copy, and returns the largest through x8.

**What a crossing costs.** A `getpid` crossing costs about 13 ns and a short `strlen` about 17 ns on an Apple M5, measured as a guest loop making ten million calls and timing itself, against 0.3 ns per iteration for the same loop with no call. An Objective-C send, `-[NSString length]`, costs about 28 ns. The arm64 builds of the same loops take 0.7, 0.9 and 3.6 ns.

| guest loop, ns per iteration | trap path (`OCERZ_NO_BRIDGE_FASTCALL=1`) | default | arm64 build |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `getpid` | 37.5 | 13.5 | 0.7 |
| `strlen` of a 12-byte string | 39.4 | 16.7 | 0.9 |
| `-[NSString length]` | 51.3 | 28.3 | 3.6 |
| `qsort` comparator, per call back into guest code | 426 | 430 | 3.1 |

Translated code does not take the trap. When the JIT translates a stub it calls the bridge from inside the block and then returns to the caller with a real `ret`, so the host return predictor stays in step with the guest's calls, where the trap path left the block, reached the bridge through the run loop and came back through the dispatcher. Only the xmm registers an export's signature reads or writes are spilled around the call, because System V leaves every xmm register volatile across a call; `__tlv_bootstrap` and `___chkstk_darwin`, whose callers rely on every register surviving, spill all sixteen. A signature whose arguments all fit in registers crosses without building a stack block, and FPCR is written only when the guest's rounding mode is not already the default. A crossing that delivers a signal, retires translated code or has to stop the thread goes back through the dispatcher.

A call back into guest code is the expensive direction: about 430 ns, most of it three system calls that save and clear the signal mask and the alternate-stack state for the callback's fault recovery point, and a copy of the 6 KB cpu.

Against cache mode, the cost shows only in code that crosses in a tight loop. Each ratio is the paired delta over the kernel at its default size and at half of it, on an Apple M5:

| kernel | native vs cache | trap path vs cache | why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `str` | 5.05x | 12.1x | `strlen` on short strings, one crossing per call |
| `memcpy` | 0.97x | 1.67x | copies large enough to amortize the crossing |
| `hash` | 0.99x | 0.99x | no bridged calls |
| `depchain` | 1.01x | 1.00x | no bridged calls |

Guest code that never crosses pays nothing, which is why the last two rows are at parity.

The mode is process-wide and fixed before the VM starts, because the JIT materializes its trap-window bounds once, and a spawned child inherits it through `OCERZ_MODE`. `tests/run_native_tests.sh` pins all of this end to end. `tests/unit/test_apidb.c`, `test_vdylib.c`, `test_bridge.c`, `test_abi.c` and `test_callback.c` pin the database format and its refusals, the synthesized image, the crossings built from the database, argument placement across the signature space, and the trampoline bank.

## Limitations

- Application compatibility is incomplete; unsupported syscalls and framework behavior remain.
- Shared-cache Objective-C images loaded after startup get their categories, but `dyld_image_path_containing_address` still returns NULL for them.
- `proc_pidpath` and `proc_name` name the guest executable only when a process asks about itself; other ocerz processes still appear as `ocerz`.
- x87 uses 64-bit doubles rather than 80-bit extended precision.
- The JIT translates most VEX code:
  - moves, integer, bitwise and compare ops, and broadcasts
  - `vpmovmskb`, most sign and zero extensions, and shifts by an immediate
  - `vzeroupper`, FMA, 256-bit packed arithmetic and the variable blends
  - `vshufps`, `vshufpd`, `vinsertps` and `vmovddup`
  - the VEX.128 forms of the SSE instructions it already translates
  - `rorx`, `shlx`, `shrx`, `sarx`, `mulx`, `andn`, and `blsr`, `blsmsk`, `blsi` and `bzhi` when their flags are dead

  Everything else that is VEX-encoded still runs in the interpreter. That includes:
  - 256-bit byte and integer shuffles, unpacks, permutes and lane inserts
  - `vptest`, the immediate blends, mask-producing compares and gathers
  - `bextr`, `pdep` and `pext`
- Inside a translated loop, scalar SSE results and the upper halves of the `ymm` registers live in host lane registers. Each block records which registers sit in which lane at every instruction, and fault recovery folds those lanes back into the CPU state, so a guest that catches a fault raised in such a loop sees the right values and the caches run in the guarded memory modes too. A NaN produced inside a batch that faults before its check keeps the arm64 payload.
- MMX instructions always run in the interpreter, and the MMX registers are kept apart from the x87 stack, so `FXSAVE` and signal frames do not carry them.
- The approximate `RCP`/`RSQRT` results are not implemented. (SSE rounding modes are: the guest's MXCSR rounding control drives the host FP rounding.)
- Guest protection changes are resolved on the host's 16 KB page boundaries.
- An asynchronous signal reaches a guest thread only when that thread next makes a syscall, or in native mode a bridged call, so a thread spinning in its own code never sees one. A signal aimed at another thread reaches its guest handler only for the signals ocerz mirrors onto the host, such as `SIGUSR1`, `SIGTERM` and `SIGALRM`, not for fault signals such as `SIGSEGV`.
- Native mode runs only programs whose calls stay inside the bridged part of libSystem, libdispatch, CoreFoundation, CoreGraphics, libobjc, Foundation and AppKit. `NSApplicationMain` stops with a named message, because it would load the main nib from ocerz's own bundle, and no `.app` has run end to end; a guest that builds classes at run time (`class_addMethod`, `objc_allocateClassPair`, `+resolveInstanceMethod:`) or calls an `IMP` it got back from the native runtime does not work yet, and a guest class whose superclass the host lacks, a Swift class and a root class are refused by name; variadic functions without a veneer, such as `open`, `fcntl`, `ioctl` and `scanf`, are not bridged, nor are functions taking a `long double`, `va_list`, union or bitfield structure; a block or function pointer written in x86 code cannot be handed to a native method or function, so `enumerateObjectsUsingBlock:` or `sortedArrayUsingFunction:context:` stops with a named message; an Objective-C exception thrown by native code cannot be caught by a guest `@try`, because nothing unwinds through guest frames yet, and a guest cannot throw one; `NSLog` names the process `ocerz`; `fork`, `exec`, `posix_spawn`, `setjmp`, `longjmp`, `mmap`, `mprotect` and `dlopen` stop with a named message, because each needs ocerz's own implementation rather than the host's; `getpagesize` and `vm_page_size` report the host's 16 KB page where Rosetta reports 4 KB; a guest that reads function pointers out of a structure a native call filled in, as the `XDR_*` macros do, would call arm64 code; a guest that is not position-independent runs with its low addresses shadowed, so a structure it hands CoreFoundation holding pointers into its own image would carry addresses native code cannot read; a C++ program fails to bind, because no x86 `libc++` is synthesized; and `environ` and `_NSGetEnviron` are not available.
